# XCUIBuilder 

**XCUIBuilder** is a Swift-based command-line tool designed to deploy a robust and reusable UI testing framework for iOS projects. By automating the creation of a structured folder hierarchy and generating pre-written examples for screens and tests, it enables seamless integration of a scalable and efficient UI testing framework into your project.

The tool deploys a framework that incorporates the functionality of the **XCUIEnhance** library, extended with a modified custom `wait()` function. Unlike the original library, which relied on raw time intervals, the modified version uses a `Timeout` enum to define durations (e.g., 'loading', 'normal', 'short'). While the framework ensures consistent timeouts across all environments, it is designed to allow easy customization if different durations are needed for mock and live environments. Such changes would require no modifications to the deployed framework, as the `wait()` function would seamlessly adapt to any updates in the `Timeout` enum.
## üöÄ Features
### Features of XCUIBuilder:
- Automates the deployment of a reusable and scalable **XCUITest framework**.
- Creates a consistent folder hierarchy, including `Support`, `Screens`, and `Tests` directories.
- Dynamically generates shared files (e.g., protocols, extensions, enums) and pattern-specific implementations tailored to your project needs.
- Guides you through the setup process via an interactive command-line interface.

### Features of the Deployed Framework:
**1. Out-of-the-Box Solution:**
  - Implements the **Page Object Model** combined with a **Builder Pattern**, providing a clean and scalable architecture for UI testing.
  - Features an advanced logging system:
    - Creates well-structured and easy-to-read logs.
    - Automatically generates log messages for assertions via `runActivity` functions.
    - Produces detailed error messages using `assert()` extensions, improving debugging efficiency.
    - Logs accurate screen names for better traceability.

**2. Flexible Chaining Patterns:**
- **Screen Transition Chaining**:
  - Every function returns an instance of the screen, which could be:
    - The same screen.
    - The next screen in the flow.
    - A generic screen when the function may navigate to different screens based on the flow (in this case, you must explicitly specify the screen name where the function will land).
  - Verifies the screen state after returning every screen, which helps manage timeouts automatically, reducing the effort required to handle asynchronous calls and complex user interactions.
  - Allows chaining functions seamlessly without needing to repeatedly specify the screen name within the same screen.
  - Offers exceptional **stability** and delivers the **highest performance**, making it the fastest and most efficient approach.
  - Example:

**Self Chaining**:
  - Always returns `self`, with the screen state verified only during initialization.
  - Produces well-readable and maintainable test code, offering a simpler and more user-friendly approach compared to **Screen Transition Chaining**.
  - Slightly slower than **Screen Transition Chaining** and, in rare cases, may require a more refined approach to handle complex user interactions effectively.
  - Despite these minor drawbacks, it remains a highly stable and reliable solution for UI testing.
  - Example:
<img width="438" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-30 at 12 39 06‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc019eed-d77b-4901-8ee0-d6deb368d947">

### 3. Comprehensive Examples:
 - Includes example screens (`LaunchScreen`, `LoginScreen`, `HomeScreen`) and UI tests.
 - Modifiable `TabBarProtocol` with a customizable `Tabs` enum and element locators.

**Pattern-Specific Examples:**

- **Screen Transition Chaining:**
  - Offers two versions of examples for writing assertions:
    1. Using the built-in `XCTAssert` functions directly within the test cases.
    2. Writing `assert` functions in the screen classes, leveraging the `assert` extensions. This approach provides automatic error message generation based on the arguments passed, simplifying debugging and improving readability.
- **Self Chaining:**
Demonstrates the second version only, where `assert` functions are implemented in screen classes using the `assert` extensions. This ensures automatic error message generation and a clean, readable test flow.


## üìÇ Folder Structure

After running XCUIBuilder, your project will follow this structure:

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Follow these steps to set up XCUIBuilder and deploy the framework version of your choice:
1. **Clone the Repository:**

Download the XCUIBuilder project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tatuliana/XCUIBuilder.git
cd XCUIBuilder
```
2. **Open the Project in Xcode:**

Open the project to start using the tool:
```bash
open XCUIBuilder.xcodeproj
```
3. **Run the Tool:**
   Click the `Run` button in Xcode to start the tool. Follow the instructions in the console:
  - **Step 1:** Enter the path to your Xcode project (e.g., `path/to/MyApp.xcodeproj` or project folder). Alternatively, you can drag your project file or folder directly into the Xcode console to automatically generate the correct path.
  - **Step 2:** Enter the name of the existing UI Testing target (e.g., `MyAppUITests`). Note: **XCUIBuilder** does not create a new UI Testing target automatically. If you don't already have a UI Testing target, you will need to create one manually in Xcode before running the tool. To do this:
    - Go to Xcode.
    - Click on your **project name** (the top line in your file navigator).
    - Click the `+` button at the bottom of the target list.
    - Select **UI Testing Bundle** and follow the prompts.
  - **Step 3:** Choose the framework version to deploy:

    **1: Screen Transition Chaining**
    
    **2: Self Chaining**
4. **Verify Setup:** After the deployment, verify that the newly created framework folders are added to your target. If the folders do not appear in Xcode, close the Xcode app and reopen your project to refresh the file structure.

## üîß Post-Deployment Customization

Once the framework has been successfully deployed, you can:

- **Remove the Deployment Tool:**
  - The tool used for deployment is no longer required after setup and can be safely removed.
- **Modify the Framework:**
  - The deployed framework is fully customizable. You are free to:
  - Add new features.
  - Adjust the directory structure.
  - Customize the configuration to suit your project needs.

**Note:** Ensure that modifications are thoroughly tested to maintain the integrity and functionality of the framework.
